# Google Data Analytics Case Study 1: Cyclistic Bike Share
## Introduction
This case study will present the culmination of every lesson that I've learned whilst completing the Google Data Analytics certificate program. I will use these skills to complete a case study for a fictional bike-share company named Cyclistic. I will help the company make data-driven decisions on how they can increase the amount of customers that sign up for annual memberships by using the data analysis process of Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. 
## Ask
### Question at Hand:
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
### Key Stakeholders
* Lily Moreno: The director of marketing at Cyclistic and my manager. She is responsible for the development of initiatives for promoting the bike-share program.
* Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps aid Cyclistic's marketing strategy.
* Cyclistic Executive Team: The notoriously detail-oriented team that decides whether to approve the new marketing program or not.
## Prepare
The first step I completed in preparation for my analysis was to download all the data that was necessary. I downloaded the Cyclistic Trip Data from 2022 and 2023 to see how customers accessed and used the bike-share. To do this, I had to download all 19 .csv files and store them in their dedicated folders. The data used was provided by Motivational International Inc. with a liscense that can be found [here](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).
