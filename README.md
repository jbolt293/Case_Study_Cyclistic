# Google Data Analytics Case Study 1: Cyclistic Bike Share
## Introduction
This case study will present the culmination of every lesson that I've learned whilst completing the Google Data Analytics certificate program. I will use these skills to complete a case study for a fictional bike-share company named Cyclistic. I will help the company make data-driven decisions on how they can increase the amount of customers that sign up for annual memberships by using the data analysis process of Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.
